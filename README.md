# Custom ERC-20 Token Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that implements a custom ERC-20 token. The contract allows you to create and manage your own token on the Ethereum blockchain, following the ERC-20 standard. You can use this contract as a starting point for building your own tokens for various purposes.

## Features

- Create your own token with customizable name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply.
- Transfer tokens between addresses.
- Manage allowances to enable address A to spend tokens on behalf of address B.
- Mint new tokens by the contract owner.
- Burn tokens to reduce the total supply.
- Increase or decrease allowances for specific addresses.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, such as a Solidity compiler and Ethereum development tools.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet or your local blockchain development environment.
4. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or through web3.js.

## Usage

1. Modify the constructor parameters in the contract code to customize the token's properties.
2. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
3. Use Ethereum wallets (such as MetaMask) or web3.js to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Mint new tokens using the `generateNewTokens` function.
5. Transfer tokens between addresses using the `initiateTokenTransfer` function.
6. Manage allowances using the `authorizeAllowance`, `transferFromWithAllowedAmount`, `increaseAllowanceAmount`, and `decreaseAllowanceAmount` functions.
7. Burn tokens using the `destroyTokens` function.

## Examples

You can find example interactions with the contract in the [examples](/examples) directory. These examples demonstrate how to deploy the contract, mint tokens, transfer tokens, and more.
